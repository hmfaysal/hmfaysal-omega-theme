<h1>Imperial Robotics Team 3734</h1>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/GroupPicture.JPG" alt="Team">

<p>We are FTC team 3734, A.K.A. Imperial Robotics located at the School of Science and Engineering in Dallas, TX. Our mission is to spread robotics in the world so that people learn how fun and engaging the robotics competitions of FIRST are. This year,
we hope to participate in several communtiy service projects and build a robot using the help of the community. We
want to bring everyone together to create something that is truely revolutional.</p>

<p>
  Hey i'm Austin, captain of Ftc team 3734 Imperial Robotics, and currently a junior at the Science and Engineering magnet at Townview
  Magnet center. I've been participating in both Ftc and Frc robotics since the 7th grade and have taken all of my past experinces from
  various roles on teams to shape the way I lead 3734, with focuses on individual involvement and learning. I joined robotics in order 
  to expand my knowladge of materials, mechanical engineering, and their applications in modern life, all of which started from my love
  of chemistry and physics.

  Hi! My name is Abhi Bhattaru. I go to the Science and Engineering Magnet at Townview and I am currently in 10th grade. Being the lead
  developer, I work closely with managing this blog and its innerworkings. I do my best to document all meetings as well as any special
  events that our team participates in. I joined robotics due my fascination with math and science and its incredible applications
  in current situations in the world.
