Today I managed to wake up early around 6 am. The sun had already risen by then and although I hadn't had much sleep, I was grateful to have awoke to what greeted me in the kitchen. The sun behind the cathedral lit up a clear blue sky, unexpectedly populated by the first swallows of Spring. 

Indeed, today is the first day of spring in the northern hemisphere - what an incredible coincidence, I hadn't even realised it at the time. 

Happy spring, everyone. Hope it brings all the fruits of a hard-worked winter that's finally over.
